# guess-game-refined
This is a guess my number game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It is originally an idea from Jonas Schmedtmann course, so I redesigned and added a little logic to create my own.

You are to guess a number between 1 and 15, click on check.

If the number guess is lower than the secret number, a message will be displayed that it is "Too low!"

If the number guess is higher than the secret number, a message will also be displayed that it is "Too high".

Note that: Whenever your guesses are wrong (low or high), your point/score is reduced.

Then if your guess is correct, a modal will pop up telling you "Congratulations, you won the game!" and also the background colour will change and your highscore will be displayed 

You can click on the again button to continue.
